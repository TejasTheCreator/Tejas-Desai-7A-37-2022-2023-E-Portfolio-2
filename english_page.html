            <span id="information">The Onge are an Andamaneese tribe which live on the Andaman Islands. They were traditionally <br>
                 hunter-gatherers and fishers, but recently, they also started cultivating crops. They live <br> 
                 on the Southern parts of the Andaman Islands. They speak the Onge Langauge, one of two known <br>
                 southern Andamanese languages. It is spoken mostly on the southern part of the Andaman Islands. <br>
                 The Onge follow the religion of Animism. Worshipping their ancestors, was a common and a important <br>
                 element in the religious traditions of the Andaman Islands. In the 1900s, they had a total population <br>
                 of about 672 however, as of 2011 it is estimated that they had a population of about 101, due to their <br>
                 changes of food habits, during the 20th century. Hence, the Onge tribe is now classified as an endangered <br>
                 tribe.
